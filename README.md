# Shop

This is a web repository for Products in a web storefront.  This will fulfill the requirements for
the C#/.NET class with Code Louisville.

Completed is the administrator section where items can be added, deleted, edited, and viewed.
There is more work to be done to flesh out my vision of a completed customer interface that will handle orders and
some basic user profiles.

The basic CRUD functions are there and data is persisted using an Entity Framework populated database.

To view this project you will need a working copy of Visual Studio or Visual Studio Community, as this is an
ASP.NET MVC web application.  Open the Shop.sln file and click the preview button.  Once the app is running,
use the top menu to navigate to "Shop" to see the section that implements the CRUD functions.
